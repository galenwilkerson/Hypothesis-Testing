## Introduction

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions or inferences about population parameters based on sample data. P-values help determine the significance of the results, and confidence intervals provide a range of plausible values for the parameter of interest. This notebook covers these concepts with practical examples and visualizations.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need to have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these packages using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/galenwilkerson/hypothesis-testing.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```sh
cd hypothesis-testing
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `Hypothesis testing, p-values, confidence intervals.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to see the implementation and results.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook covers the following steps:

1. **Introduction to Hypothesis Testing**: Explanation of null and alternative hypotheses, types of errors, and the overall testing process.
2. **Calculating P-Values**: Methods to calculate p-values for different types of tests.
3. **Constructing Confidence Intervals**: Techniques to construct confidence intervals for various parameters.
4. **Practical Examples**: Real-world examples and visualizations to illustrate the concepts.
5. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and potential applications of these statistical methods.
