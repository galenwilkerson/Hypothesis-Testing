    "### Simplified Explanation with a Gaussian Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Establish the Distribution:**\n",
    "   - Assume we know the population distribution. For a Gaussian process, this means we know the mean ($\\mu$) and standard deviation ($\\sigma$) of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collect Sample Data:**\n",
    "   - We take a sample and calculate the sample mean ($\\bar{x}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Formulate Hypotheses:**\n",
    "   - **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The sample comes from the established population distribution.\n",
    "   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** The sample comes from a different distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the Test Statistic:**\n",
    "   - Compute how far the sample mean is from the population mean in terms of standard deviations. This is often done using a z-score for large samples or a t-score for smaller samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Find the P-Value:**\n",
    "   - Determine the p-value, which is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as the observed one, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Interpret the P-Value:**\n",
    "   - If the p-value is low, it indicates that the observed sample mean is unlikely to occur if the null hypothesis is true, suggesting the sample may come from a different distribution.\n",
    "   - If the p-value is high, it indicates that the observed sample mean is likely to occur if the null hypothesis is true, suggesting the sample may come from the established distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Establish Distribution:**\n",
    "   - Population mean ($\\mu$) = 100\n",
    "   - Population standard deviation ($\\sigma$) = 15\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collect Sample Data:**\n",
    "   - Sample mean ($\\bar{x}$) = 110\n",
    "   - Sample size ($n$) = 30\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Formulate Hypotheses:**\n",
    "   - $H_0$: The sample mean is 100 (comes from the established distribution).\n",
    "   - $H_1$: The sample mean is not 100 (comes from a different distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate Test Statistic:**\n",
    "   - For a large sample, use a z-score:\n",
    "     $$ z = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{110 - 100}{15 / \\sqrt{30}} \\approx 3.65 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Find the P-Value:**\n",
    "   - Using the z-score, find the p-value from the standard normal distribution table. For $z = 3.65$, the p-value is very low.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Interpret the P-Value:**\n",
    "   - A very low p-value suggests that getting a sample mean of 110 is highly unlikely if the population mean is truly 100. Therefore, we might reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the sample likely comes from a different distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding where the observed data falls within the established distribution, we can assess how likely it is that our sample comes from the assumed population, thereby making informed conclusions about our hypotheses."

    "**Hypothesis Testing** is a statistical method used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data. The process involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Formulating Hypotheses:**\n",
    "   - **Null Hypothesis (H0):** A statement that there is no effect or no difference. It is the hypothesis that we seek to test.\n",
    "   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha):** A statement that indicates the presence of an effect or a difference. It is what we want to prove.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Selecting a Significance Level (α):**\n",
    "   - Commonly used significance levels are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10.\n",
    "   - This is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (Type I error).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Choosing the Appropriate Test:**\n",
    "   - Based on the type of data and the research question (e.g., t-test, chi-square test, ANOVA).\n",

    "4. **Calculating the Test Statistic:**\n",
    "   - A value computed from the sample data that is compared against a critical value from a statistical distribution.\n",

    "   - **Goal:** To provide a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall, with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95% confidence interval).\n",
    "   - **Interpretation:** If the null hypothesis value (e.g., $\\mu_0$) lies outside the confidence interval, it suggests that the null hypothesis may be rejected.\n",

    "## Steps in Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Formulate Hypotheses:**\n",
    "   - **Null Hypothesis (H0):** The statement being tested, typically asserting that there is no effect or no difference. It is the default assumption.\n",
    "     - Example: $ H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0 $ (The population mean is equal to a specified value $\\mu_0$).\n",
    "   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha):** The statement you want to test, suggesting that there is an effect or a difference.\n",
    "     - Example: $ H_1: \\mu \\neq \\mu_0 $ (The population mean is not equal to $\\mu_0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Select a Significance Level (α):**\n",
    "   - The significance level ($\\alpha$) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (Type I error). Common choices are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10.\n",
    "   - Example: $ \\alpha = 0.05 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Choose the Appropriate Test:**\n",
    "   - Depending on the data and the hypothesis, choose a statistical test (e.g., t-test, chi-square test, ANOVA).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the Test Statistic:**\n",
    "   - Compute the test statistic based on your sample data. The test statistic measures how far your sample statistic is from the null hypothesis parameter, standardized by the sample variability.\n",
    "   - Example (one-sample t-test):\n",
    "     $$ t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{s / \\sqrt{n}} $$\n",

    "     - $n$ is the sample size\n",

    "   - **Critical Value Approach:** Compare the test statistic to a critical value from the statistical distribution corresponding to the test.\n",
    "     - If the test statistic falls in the rejection region, reject $ H_0 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Make a Decision:**\n",
    "   - Based on the p-value or the critical value comparison, decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
